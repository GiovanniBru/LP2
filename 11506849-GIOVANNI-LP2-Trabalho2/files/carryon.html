<BODY>
Some people live that selfish desire
Some choose to shout when they speak
And they'll be the start
Caught in the flame of those deep in fire
Seeking out those with a voice
One for tomorrow

They say we've lost our minds
We've just gained control

Search endlessly, fight 'till we're free
Fly past the edge of the sea
No bended knee, no mockery
Somehow we still carry on

(Fear, fear, fear, fear, fear, fear)

Silence your fear, we've got to move higher
High like the stars in the sky
Guarding us all
Battle the will of those who conspire
Take back the passion to live
Relish the sorrow

Destroy their perfect crime
Watch the power fold

Search endlessly, fight 'till we're free
Fly past the edge of the sea
No bended knee, no mockery
Somehow we still carry on

Search endlessly, fight 'till we're free
Fly past the edge of the sea
No bended knee, no mockery
Somehow we still carry on
Carry on
